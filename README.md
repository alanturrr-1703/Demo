# Simple Node.js RESTful API

## Description

This Node.js application serves as a simple RESTful API for managing a list of items. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to interact with the data via HTTP requests. The application is built using the Express.js framework, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## Features

- **GET `/items`**: Retrieve a list of all items.
- **GET `/items/:id`**: Retrieve a specific item by its unique identifier.
- **POST `/items`**: Add a new item to the list.
- **PUT `/items/:id`**: Update an existing item.
- **DELETE `/items/:id`**: Remove an item from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and web applications.
- **npm**: The package manager for Node.js that allows us to install and manage dependencies.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in the codebase.
- **GitHub**: A platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on software development projects.

## How to Use

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the server by running `node app.js`.
5. Use tools like Postman to send HTTP requests to interact with the API endpoints.

## Version Control and Hosting

The application code is version controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub. This allows for easy collaboration, version tracking, and deployment of updates.

## Purpose

This application can serve as a starting point for building more complex APIs or as a learning resource for developers interested in Node.js and Express.js. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as routing, middleware, request handling, and data manipulation.
